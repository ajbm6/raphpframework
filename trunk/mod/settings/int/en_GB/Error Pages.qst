Website error pages are pages like the 404 error page (the Not Found error), or
the 403 error page, usually generated by Apache. We allow you to define the content of those error pages, using this simple
WYSIWYG editor. We will provide a default template, but most of the times the text in those pages will be up to you to edit.
