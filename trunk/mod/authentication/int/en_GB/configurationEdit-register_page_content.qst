The page where the "Register" form is invoked, needs to have some kind of message that explains the advantages that are given to 
registered users, or how the form is used. This has become a standard in time, and we allow you to edit that message here, by an 
WYSIWYG editor ... the message here will be used in the register widget we invoke on the registration page, above the registration
form built for your application ...
