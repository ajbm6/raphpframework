Having groups is a good way to keeping things organized. For users that need some special abilities, you can make groups and give
those users special access to some parts of the application you need to. Usually, creating a child of a parent group will give you
access to an already mapped zone ... If you, by change have more than 10 groups (no change, but you may never know) click the
'Show all' button to view them all for a better perspective ...
