Once you create a group, what you can actually do is just to rename it. Changing the hierarchy isn't allowed due to changes in the
tree which cause weird things to happen if the users isn't prepared to deal with some weird permission inheritances ... In the future
we will add more properties for groups that you can edit, but for the moment this is enough, as groups are actually concepts of
users that share the same properties ...
