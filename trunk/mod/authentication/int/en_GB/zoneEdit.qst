After a zone is created either automatically (by the system) or by the user (if allowed) - the only thing you can to is to actually
edit its name, price or description. Changing the hierarchy tree is not supported due to (weird) changes in permissions ... We do
allow you to edit the price of a zone (to provide services based on that zone) and the description - in the case that you have a lot
of zones that you forget about what they are ...
