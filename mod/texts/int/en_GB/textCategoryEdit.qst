Categories (or sections as we like to call'em) are closelly bound to executed PHP code, SO BE VERY careful when you edit category
names as they result in errors in your application (website or other). Make sure you know what you are doing here before trying to
do anything that you think you don't know the full implications to it. You're made totally responsible for what you do here as we
don't provide any warranty if you make changes that aren't compatible ...
