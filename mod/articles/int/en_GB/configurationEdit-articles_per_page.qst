When showing category pages, we limit the number of articles to a given number. You can set how many articles should be shown per
page by editing the below field. After that, the changes will be made instant and paginations will be limited to that number ... We
actually recommend a value between 10 and 50 items per page to still be SEO friendly (max 100 items per page), but you can go beyond 
that at your own risk.
