Comments are added by users of your application, either registered or not. You will receive a notification when a comment is added,
and usually, you will come to this editing interface to either approve or deny a comment. To keep things straight, we only give
you the possibility to edit the comment text, approve or deny the comment, nothing more, keeping things as simple as we can possibly
make'em for you and your users ...
