You can change your subscriber info from here, for example his first and last name, the way he wants to receive newsletters from you,
his email address or the kind (category) of emails he wants to receive. Whatever you do, make sure that the email you enter is unique
in your database, just to make sure that we do not send-out copies which would just fill-up the mailbox of your subscriber, which
would make your company image go down quickly ...
