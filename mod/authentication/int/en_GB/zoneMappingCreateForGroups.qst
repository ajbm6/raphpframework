Groups can be mapped to zones and an access flag can be given to them. For example, they can be denied or allowed in a zone, which
would give'em the possibility to use a specific feature of your application or not. You can create such mappings here and changes
will be instant ... Try to be carefull when you edit permissions as you may make some of your users mad of un-announced changes and
bugs that can appear due to changes on a LIVE application ...
