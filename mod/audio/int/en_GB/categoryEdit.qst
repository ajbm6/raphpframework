We allow you only to change the name and description of a category. We do not allow you to edit the cateogry hierarchy from here, 
because that would make a lot of problems appear when the user is unable to view the whole hierarchy at once. If a category exist 
and you edit the name of the category with one that exists, we will warn you that this cannot be done, as we only allow unique 
category names around the structure ...
